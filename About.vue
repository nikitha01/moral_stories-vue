      <p class="org-description is-size-4">Moral stories serve as a useful platform to educate listeners, especially young minds. Literature claims that value-based stories are an extremely useful tool in character education because stories form mental images in children's minds. It is an idyllic medium through which children can be taught valuable lessons about life because the engaging narratives captivate even young children's attention.</p>
      <p class="org-description is-size-4">We, bring to the young minds a platform to help them inhibit values and morals for personality development as it plays a major role in ones life!</p>
